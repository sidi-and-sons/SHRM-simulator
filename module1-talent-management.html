                        Hi,<br><br>
                        Recent new hire surveys show our onboarding gets poor ratings. Common complaints: "felt lost the first month," "my manager was too busy for me," and "unclear expectations." New hires are taking 6+ months to reach full productivity. Leadership wants this fixed but won't approve additional headcount for a dedicated onboarding team. Ideas?<br><br>

                            A) Design a structured 90-day onboarding framework with clear milestones, implement a buddy system using existing employees, create role-specific checklists for managers, and establish regular check-ins at 30/60/90 days.

                        Leadership has noticed our recent hires lack diversity. Looking at our data, our candidate pools are homogeneous from the start. Our job postings go to the same job boards, and we get referrals from our current (not diverse) workforce. I want to improve this but need guidance on effective, legal approaches.
