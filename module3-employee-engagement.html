                        Hi Team,<br><br>
                        Our annual engagement survey results just came back. Overall engagement dropped from 72% to 58%. The biggest drops were in "I feel valued by leadership" (down 20 points) and "I see a future for myself here" (down 18 points). The CEO is concerned and wants an action plan. How should we approach this?<br><br>

                        My team has been working 60+ hour weeks for the past 3 months due to a major client implementation. They're exhausted, and I'm seeing signs of burnout - missed deadlines, short tempers, increased sick days. I've asked for more resources but was told the budget doesn't allow it. How can I support my team without additional headcount?<br><br>

                            A) Help Diana prioritize and defer non-critical work, implement temporary schedule flexibility, recognize individual contributions, advocate for compensatory time off, and build a business case showing burnout costs vs. resource investment.

                        I want to implement a recognition program for my sales team. I'm thinking monthly MVP awards with gift cards. But I'm worried it might demotivate people who never win, and some reps have easier territories. Also, my top performers say they don't care about public recognition - they want money. What approach would work best?<br><br>

                            A) Design a multi-faceted program with peer-to-peer recognition, individual improvement awards, team achievements, and choices between public acknowledgment or private rewards to address different motivations and fairness concerns.

                            B) Recommend recognition categories that go beyond sales numbers (customer feedback, mentoring others, biggest improvement) and let winners choose between public recognition or bonus compensation.

                        <button class="response-option" onclick="selectAnswer(4, 'C', 55, 'acceptable')">
                            C) Suggest focusing on spot bonuses tied to specific achievements rather than monthly awards, removing the competitive element while still recognizing contributions.

                        <button class="response-option" onclick="selectAnswer(4, 'D', 30, 'poor')">
                            D) Recommend keeping recognition simple with quarterly bonuses based on sales targets, since money is what salespeople are most motivated by.

                        We invested significantly in a new learning platform with hundreds of courses, but participation is only 12%. Employees say they don't have time to take courses during work hours, and managers aren't encouraging it. How do we increase engagement with professional development when everyone is so busy?<br><br>

                            A) Work with leadership to allocate dedicated learning time, tie development to career progression, include manager goals for team development, create learning paths aligned with role needs, and measure completion in performance discussions.

                            A) Help Michelle present Kevin with data connecting his team's low engagement to turnover costs and productivity impacts. Include leadership behaviors in his performance expectations and provide coaching on effective management practices.
