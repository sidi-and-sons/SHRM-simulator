                        Hi HR,<br><br>
                        We have a problem. To attract talent in this competitive market, we've been hiring new accountants at salaries higher than what we pay experienced staff. My senior accountant with 8 years here just found out a new hire makes $5,000 more than her. She's furious and threatening to leave. How do we address this without blowing up our salary budget?<br><br>

                            A) Conduct a comprehensive pay equity analysis, develop a phased adjustment plan for compressed salaries, communicate transparently about the market dynamics, and review your compensation strategy to prevent future compression.

                        This year's bonus pool is 15% smaller than last year due to missed revenue targets. Some departments exceeded goals while others dragged down results. Do we cut everyone's bonus equally, or differentiate based on department performance? The sales team hit 120% of target and expects big payouts, but marketing missed badly. What's fair?<br><br>

                        Our health insurance renewal came back with a 22% premium increase. Leadership says we can't absorb the full cost increase and must pass some to employees. Our current employee contribution is already at market average. How do we implement increased costs without hurting employee morale or driving people to decline coverage?<br><br>

                            A) Explore alternative plan designs (higher deductible options, HSA contributions, tiered networks), split the increase between company and employees, enhance wellness programs to reduce claims, and communicate transparently about market conditions.

                            B) Shop alternative carriers to reduce the increase, introduce a high-deductible plan option with company HSA contributions, and phase in employee contribution increases over two years.

                            D) Reduce benefits coverage (higher copays, less covered services) to keep employee premium contributions the same, since people are more sensitive to paycheck deductions.

                        Hi,<br><br>
                        New state laws require us to post salary ranges on job postings. But our current ranges are wide (e.g., $60K-$120K for one role), and some current employees earn below the posted ranges. Employees are asking why they're paid less than what we're advertising. How do we handle this?<br><br>

                            A) Audit current pay against posted ranges and market data, bring underpaid employees to minimum of ranges, tighten ranges based on job families and levels, train managers on explaining pay decisions, and develop clear pay progression criteria.

                            B) Immediately adjust any employees below posted minimums, narrow the ranges to reflect realistic pay for each level, and prepare managers with talking points explaining pay philosophy and how positions in range are determined.

                            A) Have a conversation with Priya to understand if pay was the only driver or if there are other factors. Consider a counter only if addressing legitimate market misalignment, ensure equity with peers, and recognize that accepted counter-offers often lead to departure within a year.

                            B) Evaluate whether Priya's current salary is below market, and if so, make an adjustment that also includes a path to the senior title she was offered. Be prepared for her to leave anyway and plan for succession.

                            C) Make a competitive counter-offer to retain her through the launch, while beginning succession planning and addressing compensation proactively for other at-risk employees.

                            D) Match the offer to keep Priya since losing her before the launch would be disastrous and her replacement would cost at least that much anyway.
