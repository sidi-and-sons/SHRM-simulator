                        Hi HR,<br><br>
                        Our most experienced maintenance technician, Frank, is retiring in 6 weeks after 35 years. He's the only one who knows how to repair our legacy equipment, and that knowledge is in his head, not documented anywhere. He's willing to help transfer knowledge but I'm not sure the best approach. How do we capture his expertise before he leaves?<br><br>

                            A) Implement a structured knowledge transfer program: assign a successor to shadow Frank, have him create video tutorials for complex procedures, document troubleshooting guides, and schedule ongoing consulting availability post-retirement.

                        Hi,<br><br>
                        A senior engineer just left for a competitor, and I'm worried she took proprietary knowledge with her. We need to balance open knowledge sharing internally with protecting our competitive advantages. How do we encourage collaboration while ensuring sensitive knowledge doesn't walk out the door?<br><br>

                        It takes our new customer service reps 6 months to become fully productive. During that time, they rely heavily on senior reps for guidance, which pulls experienced staff from their work. We need to accelerate learning curves while reducing the burden on tenured employees.
