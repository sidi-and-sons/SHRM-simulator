                        I need to report something that's been happening. My supervisor, James, makes comments about my appearance almost daily. Yesterday he said I "looked hot" in my dress and asked if I was "trying to impress someone." When I don't respond, he gets cold and assigns me less desirable accounts. I'm afraid of retaliation but can't take this anymore. Please help.<br><br>

                        I need guidance on a situation. One of my forklift operators, Derek, came in today smelling strongly of marijuana. He seems to be functioning fine, but the smell is unmistakable. Other employees have noticed too. We're in a state where recreational marijuana is legal, but he operates heavy machinery. What should I do?<br><br>

                            A) Instruct Tom to immediately remove Derek from safety-sensitive duties, privately document observations, conduct a reasonable suspicion assessment following company policy, and arrange for testing if warranted while ensuring Derek doesn't drive himself.

                        <button class="response-option" onclick="selectAnswer(2, 'D', 30, 'poor')">
                            D) Advise Tom that since marijuana is legal in your state and Derek appears functional, he should monitor the situation but can't take action based on smell alone.

                            A) Work with Patricia and Ahmed to explore reasonable accommodations such as flexible scheduling, shift swaps, or adjusted break times that meet religious needs while minimizing operational impact, documenting the interactive process.

                            A) Advise Kevin that Maya's post likely constitutes protected concerted activity under the NLRA. Focus instead on understanding employee concerns about compensation through proper channels like town halls or surveys.

                        Hello HR,<br><br>
                        I have two employees, Jake and Maria, who can't seem to work together. They argue constantly, refuse to collaborate, and it's affecting the whole team. Each blames the other. Jake says Maria undermines his ideas in meetings. Maria says Jake takes credit for her work. I've tried talking to both, but nothing changes. Help!<br><br>

                            A) Meet separately with Jake and Maria to understand each perspective, then facilitate a structured mediation session focused on specific behaviors, clear expectations, and documented agreements, with follow-up accountability measures.

                        I gave Diane a negative performance review last week - all documented and accurate. Today she stormed into my office saying the review was "discriminatory" because she's the only woman on the team and threatened to sue. She has been underperforming for months, and I have documentation. But now I'm worried about taking further action. What should I do?<br><br>

                            A) Review all documentation for consistency, ensure Diane was evaluated using the same criteria as male colleagues, continue to address performance issues fairly while documenting everything, and consult with legal counsel about the threat.

                        Carlos has been on intermittent FMLA leave for chronic back pain - usually Mondays and Fridays. Another employee sent me a Facebook photo of Carlos at a music festival last weekend, standing and dancing. If his back is so bad he can't work, how is he partying? I think he's abusing FMLA. Can I investigate?<br><br>

                            A) Explain that a single photo doesn't prove FMLA abuse, as chronic conditions can have good and bad days. If there's a pattern of suspicious behavior, request recertification through proper channels rather than social media surveillance.

                            B) Advise Lisa that while concern is understandable, one photo isn't conclusive. If she has documented concerns about a pattern, HR can request updated medical certification to verify the ongoing need.

                        <button class="response-option" onclick="selectAnswer(7, 'C', 50, 'acceptable')">
                            C) Note the concern and add it to Carlos's file, then monitor the situation to see if a pattern of questionable FMLA use emerges before taking action.
                        </button>
                        <button class="response-option" onclick="selectAnswer(7, 'D', 30, 'poor')">
                            D) Have a conversation with Carlos about the photo and ask him to explain how attending a festival is consistent with his medical condition preventing work.

                            E) Use the photo as evidence to deny future FMLA requests and initiate investigation for potential fraud, as employees shouldn't be partying while claiming they can't work.
