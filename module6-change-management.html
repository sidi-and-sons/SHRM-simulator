                        Hi HR,<br><br>
                        We're implementing a new ERP system that will change how every department works. The project is already underway with IT and consultants. Leadership wants to announce it company-wide next week. I'm worried about resistance - people hate when things get dropped on them. How should we approach the communication and rollout?<br><br>

These are experienced, high-performing people whose opinions carry weight with junior staff. I need their buy-in or this will fail. How do I bring them along?<br><br>

                        Hello,<br><br>
                        We've rolled out three major initiatives in 18 months - new performance system, organizational restructure, and a software migration. Another change is coming (wellness program overhaul). Employees are exhausted and cynical. They roll their eyes at new initiatives. How do we combat change fatigue and restore engagement?<br><br>

                            A) Recommend pausing or slowing the wellness rollout, acknowledge change fatigue openly, celebrate wins from completed initiatives, stabilize before introducing more change, and create a change portfolio view to prevent future overload.

                        <button class="response-option" onclick="selectAnswer(5, 'B', 80, 'good')">
                            B) Sequence the wellness program later, acknowledge employees' feelings about change volume, ensure previous changes are embedded before adding more, and involve employees in shaping the wellness program.
                        </button>
                        <button class="response-option" onclick="selectAnswer(5, 'C', 55, 'acceptable')">
                            C) Keep the wellness program but reduce its scope, simplify the implementation, and frame it as supportive rather than another thing employees must do.
                        </button>
                        <button class="response-option" onclick="selectAnswer(5, 'D', 30, 'poor')">
                            D) Proceed with the wellness program as planned since employee health is important, but improve communication to explain why this particular change benefits employees.
                        </button>
                        <button class="response-option" onclick="selectAnswer(5, 'E', 10, 'problematic')">
                            E) Push through the change since cynicism is normal and employees will adjust eventually. Delaying changes because employees are tired sets a bad precedent.

                        Our transformation initiatives keep stalling at the middle management level. Senior leadership is committed, frontline employees seem ready, but managers in between aren't championing changes. They're overwhelmed, skeptical, or worried about losing power. They do the minimum required. How do we activate this critical layer?<br><br>

                        Leadership wants proof that our change management investments are paying off. They want to see ROI. But how do you measure cultural change or employee adoption?

                            A) Develop a balanced scorecard with leading indicators (training completion, awareness, engagement) and lagging indicators (adoption rates, productivity, business outcomes), track sentiment through pulse surveys, and connect behavioral change to business metrics.
